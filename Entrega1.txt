Difficulties and bugs:
- We had a very tough time trying to understand how to connect both the client and the server together, the Parse of the IP gave us some problems.
- When we discovered what went wrong we met another obstacle, the message was wrongly sent, and it was received as an empty package.
- The server only worked if it was opened from a build (not the unity editor).
- One player could only see another player after they moved for the first time. (Solved)
- Tanks break through walls, this should not happen in the final delivery.
- More than 4 players break the game (a player cap is needed)
- There is no game loop yet, the players don't receive damage.
