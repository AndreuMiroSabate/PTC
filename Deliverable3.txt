- We had a very tough time trying to understand how to connect both the client and the server together, the Parse of the IP gave us some problems.
- When we discovered what went wrong we met another obstacle, the message was wrongly sent, and it was received as an empty package.
- The server only worked if it was opened from a build (not the unity editor).
- One player could only see another player after they moved for the first time.
